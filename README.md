### Useful resources

- [`@extend`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/extend/) - There are often cases when designing a page when one class should have all the styles of another class, as well as its own specific styles. Sass’s `@extend` rule solves this. It’s written `@extend <selector>`, and it tells Sass that one selector should inherit the styles of another.
- [Scripts and Event Handling (Astro)](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/) - You can add interactivity to your Astro components without using a UI framework using standard HTML `<script>` tags. This allows you to send JavaScript to run in the browser and add functionality to your Astro components.
- [`@astrojs/react`](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/integrations-guide/react/) - This Astro integration enables server-side rendering and client-side hydration for your React components.
<!-- - [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. -->
- [`px` to `em` Conversion](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_pxtoemconversion.asp#gsc.tab=0) - A tool that allows you to work out the em sizes from pixels (or vice versa).
- [Change Color of SVG on Hover](https://css-tricks.com/change-color-of-svg-on-hover/) - The tactic for recoloring that SVG in different states or conditions.
