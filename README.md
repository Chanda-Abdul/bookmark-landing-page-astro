## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the site depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Receive an error message when the newsletter form is submitted if:
  - The input field is empty
  - The email address is not formatted correctly

### Screenshot

![](./screenshot.jpg)

Add a screenshot of your solution. The easiest way to do this is to use Firefox to view your project, right-click the page and select "Take a Screenshot". You can choose either a full-height screenshot or a cropped one based on how long the page is. If it's very long, it might be best to crop it.

Alternatively, you can use a tool like [FireShot](https://getfireshot.com/) to take the screenshot. FireShot has a free option, so you don't need to purchase it. 

Then crop/optimize/edit your image however you like, add it to your project, and update the file path in the image above.

**Note: Delete this note and the paragraphs above when you add your screenshot. If you prefer not to add a screenshot, feel free to remove this entire section.**

### What I learned

Use this section to recap over some of your major learnings while working through this project. Writing these out and providing code samples of areas you want to highlight is a great way to reinforce your own knowledge.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<h1>Some HTML code I'm proud of</h1>
```
```css
.proud-of-this-css {
  color: papayawhip;
}
```
```js
const proudOfThisFunc = () => {
  console.log('ðŸŽ‰')
}
```

If you want more help with writing markdown, we'd recommend checking out [The Markdown Guide](https://www.markdownguide.org/) to learn more.

### Continued development

Use this section to outline areas that you want to continue focusing on in future projects. These could be concepts you're still not completely comfortable with or techniques you found useful that you want to refine and perfect.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**

### Useful resources

- [`@extend`](https://sass-lang.com/documentation/at-rules/extend/) - There are often cases when designing a page when one class should have all the styles of another class, as well as its own specific styles. Sassâ€™s `@extend` rule solves this. Itâ€™s written `@extend <selector>`, and it tells Sass that one selector should inherit the styles of another.
- [Scripts and Event Handling (Astro)](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/client-side-scripts/) - You can add interactivity to your Astro components without using a UI framework using standard HTML `<script>` tags. This allows you to send JavaScript to run in the browser and add functionality to your Astro components.
<!-- - [Example resource 1](https://www.example.com) - This helped me for XYZ reason. I really liked this pattern and will use it going forward. -->
<!-- - [Example resource 2](https://www.example.com) - This is an amazing article which helped me finally understand XYZ. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept. -->
- [`px` to `em` Conversion](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/ref_pxtoemconversion.asp#gsc.tab=0) - A tool that allows you to work out the em sizes from pixels (or vice versa).
- [Change Color of SVG on Hover](https://css-tricks.com/change-color-of-svg-on-hover/) - The tactic for recoloring that SVG in different states or conditions.
